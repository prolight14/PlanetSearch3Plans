Planet Search 3 storyline
=========================

The game opens with the camera aiming at a little girl who is a brownette or a red head it doesn't matter. She's looking down at something. She's with a luma/animal type thing. But a little backstory about her. She's lost both of her parents (Bluimere and Timpani, possibly?) it's very sad. But she found an animal to comfort her! There's glowing lights around her, she's in a cave. But what's her name? It's Isabella (for now)

She sighs and says "You know things would've been different if I hadn't of found this creature" (she's holding a blue/green glowing butterfly or a cat or a dog)

You (Helix) must go and find/get this girl Isabella (who is a princess)

*Spoiler*
The creature Isabella is with is actually her mom!
*End Spoiler*

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Now hero you must save the universe and find this girl's parents! But how will you do so? By manipulating time and space!

Implementation notes:
You must keep all rendering separate from the update code.
You should keep things running at the same speed at every fps. So any velocities being applied to position should be multiplied by a delta given by the fps catcher.  

Don't get rid of! It's for desmos.
y=y\cdot\sinh\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^{2}\cdot\cos\left(10x^{2}+y^{2}\right)\cdot14
